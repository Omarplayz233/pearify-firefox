# YouTube Pearify

Do you find that the YouTube page is a bit lacking?
Do you find it deprived of something?

**Fear no more.**

This funny extension adds the famous YouTuber **RoyalPear** (or tropius)
to every nook and cranny of YouTube! (also featuring nera and aren) 
This includes the thumbnails, thumbnails, thumbnails... oh and the logo too.

## Notes

- This extension is heavily inspired by; and takes code from the original extension: **[MrBeastify][UI Website]**, by **[MagicJohn][UI YouTube]**.
- This extension is not officialy affiliated with YouTube, RoyalPear, nor Tropius.
- Don't expect this to be updated much. 

## Microsoft Edge <a id="microsoftedge"></a>

Microsoft Edge support has been ended, and the extension has been delisted. This is because Edge is consistently the slowest at reviewing extensions, constantly rejects my submissions with vague reasons why, and are allround terrible. Download the Chrome version instead.
